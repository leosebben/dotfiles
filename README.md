## Description

This repository contains personalized configuration files for popular development tools such as NeoVim, Tmux, and Zsh. The configurations are tailored to complement the iTerm2 terminal emulator, which employs a custom color scheme that I made based on [common](https://github.com/jackharrisonsherlock/common).

## Quick Install

```
git clone https://github.com/leosebben/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles --depth 1
